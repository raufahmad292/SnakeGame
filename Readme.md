# Introduction
This is copy of classical nokia snake game. This project was built using assemble 8088 architecture. There are random fruits generated on the screen and the snake eats them in order to grow. After sometime a bonus stage also appears with fruits having greater points. Once the snake bites the walls or itself you are out and your score is displayed. This project uses the core concepts of the four segments in assembly 8088 architecture (Code, Data, Stack and Extra segment).
